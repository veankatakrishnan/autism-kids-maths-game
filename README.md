## 📌 Overview & Use Case

**Math Explorer** is a specialized, interactive educational web application designed to teach fundamental mathematical concepts—Rounding, Place Value, and Roman Numerals—to children, specifically tailored with neurodivergent (Autistic) learners in mind. 

The application utilizes an elegant, high-contrast **Black & White** minimalist theme. This purposeful design decision completely eliminates colorful, distracting visual clutter (like gradients, bright emojis, or chaotic backgrounds). By limiting sensory input to stark, readable contrasts, it helps autistic learners maintain intense, unbroken focus on the educational task at hand without suffering from sensory overload.

## 🚀 Modules & Topics Covered

The application is split into three core interactive Game Modules and one Progress Tracking Module:

### 1. 🎢 Rounding Roller Coaster (Rounding Game)
*   **Topic**: Rounding numbers to the nearest 10 or 100.
*   **Use Case**: Teaches spatial number sense.
*   **Mechanics**: Users are presented with a horizontal, interactive Number Line. They must visually determine which "major tick" (multiple of 10) the target number is closest to and input their answer.

### 2. 🧱 Place Value Builder (Place Value Game)
*   **Topic**: Understanding base-10 numerical construction (Hundreds, Tens, Ones).
*   **Use Case**: Deconstructs abstract numbers into concrete, countable visual blocks.
*   **Mechanics**: Users must "build" a target number (e.g., `124`) by clicking `+` and `-` buttons to add distinct grid blocks into horizontal rows corresponding to Hundreds, Tens, and Ones.

### 3. 🏛️ Roman Numeral Quest (Roman Numerals Game)
*   **Topic**: Decoding and encoding ancient Roman Numerals (I, V, X, L, C, D, M).
*   **Use Case**: Teaches symbol-to-value translation and addition/subtraction rules in numeral formatting.
*   **Mechanics**: Users construct the Roman Numeral string for a given integer using a dedicated, minimalist keypad.

### 4. 📊 Progress & Analytics
*   **Topic**: Session monitoring and growth tracking.
*   **Use Case**: Allows parents, educators, and the children themselves to visually track their accuracy, streaks, and engagement metrics across all games over time.

## 📖 Instructions for First-Time Users

Welcome to Math Explorer! Here is how to get started:

1.  **Open the App**: Navigate to the [Live Link](https://veankatakrishnan.github.io/autism-kids-maths-game/).
2.  **Choose a Module**: On the stark white Home Page, you will see three main game boxes. Click **"Play Now →"** on any game of your choice.
3.  **Playing the Game**:
    *   Read the target objective at the top of the screen (e.g., *"Round the number 59 to the nearest 10"*).
    *   Use the interactive elements (Number Line, Block +/- buttons, or Keypad) to form your answer.
    *   Click the solid black **Check Answer** button.
    *   You will receive highly contrasted, clear feedback (Success vs. Try Again).
4.  **Tracking Progress**: At any time, click the **Progress** button in the top navigation bar to view your overall score and accuracy charts.
5.  **Navigation**: Use the crisp white Navigation Bar at the top to seamlessly switch between games without losing your flow.
